    <td class="Sub1"> A landslide is the movement of rocks and soil down a slope and, when a large slide occursmin a area of
    dense the human habitation, large number of people can be killed. In January 2011 mudslides in south eastern brazil killed     more than 400 people. <br />
    Many natural event such as heavy rainfall, an earthquake or volcano can trigger a landslide, but humain activities such as     building constructions can also cause or increse the chance of such an event. <br />
    The biggest landslide in recoard history was triggered by the eruption of Mount St Helens in 1980 , according the UNited     States Geological survey. Nearly 3km of rock moved down slope.

    <td class="sub3" width="550"> A landslide, also known as a landslip, is a form of mass wasting that includes a wide range of ground movements, such as rockfalls, deep failure of slopes, and shallow debris flows. Landslides can occur underwater, called a submarine landslide, coastal and onshore environments. Although the action of gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur, there are other contributing factors affecting the original slope stability. Typically, pre-conditional factors build up specific sub-surface conditions that make the area/slope prone to failure, whereas the actual landslide often requires a trigger before being released. Landslides should not be confused with mudflows, a form of mass wasting involving very to extremely rapid flow of debris that has become partially or fully liquefied by the addition of significant amounts of water to the source material.

      </td>
    <td class="sub3" width="50"> </td>
    <td class="sub3"> Landslides occur when the slope changes from a stable to an unstable condition. A change in the stability of a slope can be caused by a number of factors, acting together or alone. Natural causes of landslides include:

groundwater (pore water) pressure acting to destabilize the slope
loss or absence of vertical vegetative structure, soil nutrients, and soil structure (e.g. after a wildfire – a fire in forests lasting for 3–4 days)
<ul type="disc">
<li> Erosion of the toe of a slope by rivers or ocean waves </li>
<li>Weakening of a slope through saturation by snow melting, glaciers melting, or heavy rain </li>
<li>Earthquakes adding loads to barely stable slope </li>
<li>Earthquake-caused liquefaction destabilizing slopes </li>
<li>Volcanic eruptions </li>
