    <td class="Sub1"> Floods have a variety of causes including heavy rainfall, tidal surges and the failure of man made
    structures such as dams. During the flood and area of land that is normaly dry iscovered by water. <br /> heavy rainfall over
    a short time period caused the 2004 Boscastle flood in north Cornwall,UK . The village of Boscastal, which is located in a    steep sided valley, was overwhelmed when rivers runing through the area broke their banks. <br /> Some floods are seasonal
    Large area of Bangladesh, for example, are submerged each year when the monsoon raons causethat country's rivers to break 			    their banks.Monsoon floods in Bangladesh and other parts of the world take lives, make thosands homeless and spread disease.

    <td width="550" class="sub3"> A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land which is usually dry. The European Union (EU) Floods Directive defines a flood as a covering by water of land not normally covered by water. In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide.
Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals.
Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. While riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water, people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry.
Some floods develop slowly, while others such as flash floods, can develop in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain. Additionally, floods can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins.

    <td width="400" class="sub3"> Disadvantages of the Flood
The heavy floods can be so disastrous that the infrastructure is washed away , The people and the animals drown , and the people can be stranded for long periods , The society and the economy of the country will suffer in many ways after the flood .

You have to know that the loss of the lives , the vegetation , and the infrastructure means there will be fewer people on the labor force , less agriculture available for the locals and the exportation , and less businesses to contribute to the economy of the country .
